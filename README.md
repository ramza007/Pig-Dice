## Description
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":
* If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
* If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
* If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
